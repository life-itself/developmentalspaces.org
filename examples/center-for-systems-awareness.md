# Center for Systems Awareness  

The Center for Systems Awareness is a global group of changemakers, based primarily in Boston, which puts together workshops, events, and curriculums to help systems transformation. 

## Vision  

The Center for Systems Awareness exists to advance systems change in education based on the idea that profound inter-connectedness sits behind all these ideas and connects them.
## Core values 

The Center for Systems change adopts and uses the 'mandala for systems change', outlined below with the following four questions: 

- What are we seeking to accomplish? (_Practice_)
- What are we seeking to learn, especially that can benefit others beyond ourselves? (_Research_)
- How do we need to learn and grow, individually and collectively, to be successful? (_Capacity building_)
- Who is the “we”and what is the quality of the relational space we create? (_Community building_)
