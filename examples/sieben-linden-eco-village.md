# Sieben Linden Eco Village

Sieben Linden is a _Developmental Space_ by design and ethos: a living laboratory for personal, interpersonal, and systemic transformation, rooted in ecological sustainability. Physical architecture—from straw-bale buildings and composting toilets to localized food and energy systems—are constructed with care for ecological impact, while social structures are designed for relational and emotional intelligence. For residents and visitors, **growing up, and cleaning up are part of daily life**.

## Vision

To realize **collaborative and holistic sustainable lifestyles**, connecting a **small ecological footprint with a high quality of life**. The community aims to function as a **transformational commons**, supporting individuals and collectives in becoming more resilient, reflexive, and regenerative.

## Core values

Sieben Linden applies its sustainability approach across **four dimensions**: **Ecology, Economy, Social, and Culture**. It nurtures a culture of **‘cleaning up’** in a container of psychological safety, diversity of perspective, and community accountability. This is exemplified by its **slow, inclusive decision-making** culture, which prioritizes learning, dialogue, and long-term coherence over efficiency.

## Program

The ecovillage offers a variety of educational opportunities, including:

  * **Courses and Seminars:** Such as 'Eco-village Living' and 'Exploring Money, Power, and Decision-Making in Community'.
  * **Mitarbeitswochen** (work weeks) and **Kennenlernseminare** (intro seminars) for visitors.
  * **Voluntary Services** (e.g., FÖJ, BFD) and **Internships**.

## Practices

Daily life and practices are centered on co-evolution and self-sufficiency. These include:

  * **Ecological Infrastructure:** Maintaining straw-bale buildings, composting toilets, a sewage treatment plant, and solar panel systems.
  * **Local Food Systems:** Cultivating fruits and vegetables for self-sufficiency in the garden.
  * **Community Structure:** Operating as a cooperatively organised village with a commitment to living in harmony with one another and the Earth.
