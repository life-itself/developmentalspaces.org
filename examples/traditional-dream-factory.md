# Traditional Dream Factory  

Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) is a regenerative co-living space that combines technology and nature. It is a prototype for creating modern and comfortable regenerative housing ecosystems. TDF is designed to be a co-living, a farm, a makers space.

## Core values 

Improve the biodiversity of existing natural ecosystems and the quality of life for present and future generations while allowing its Members to access, steward and enjoy the facilities and natural ecosystems on these lands.
