# Tamera Eco Village

Tamera is a peace research village in Portugal integrating inner work, collective life, and systemic transformation. Founded in 1995 (with roots to 1978), Tamera is an intentional community with approximately 160 residents dedicated to healing relationships between people, the Earth, and all forms of life.

## Vision

Tamera exists to model and create Healing Biotopes - experimental nodes of a future culture rooted in cooperation, truth, and love. A "healing biotope" is described as "a greenhouse of trust, an acupuncture point of peace." The community believes that a few peace research villages of sufficient size and complexity can create cultural healing on a global level through morphic field resonance. Tamera works to build Terra Nova: a planetary culture of autonomous and interconnected communities.

## Core values

Tamera is built on **deep commitment to inner development as a collective process**, operating on the principle that "we can only create as much peace outside ourselves as we have created inside ourselves."

**Trust as Foundation.** Creating structural peace requires ongoing spiritual training connecting individuals to light, joy, and love.

**Truth and Transparency.** Members share responsibility for relational care, conflict resolution, and emotional transparency.

**Healing of Love.** The community works to liberate love from fear, addressing historical suppression of sexuality through transparency and community support.

**Inseparability of Inner and Outer Healing.** Daily practices are embedded in the landscape itself, seen in their transformation of arid terrain into a thriving Water Retention Landscape.

## Program

Introduction Weeks (7-10 days) provide overview of Tamera's research areas including community building, love and sexuality, and spiritual life practice. The Global Love School is a 3-year program for leaders exploring how personal issues in love are part of broader cultural transformation. The Community Course (4 weeks) serves as preparation for potential membership. Tamera also offers specialized seminars, a Youth Camp (ages 14-17), and Community Service Programs.
