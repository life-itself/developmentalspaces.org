title: What is a (deliberately) developmental space?
---

## Preface: Centers more than boundaries

In talking about the "what" of developmental spaces we emphasize that we prefer the metaphor of centers rather than boundaries. That is, we offer definitions as outlines of a *center* of a conceptual field for developmental spaces -- which a given concrete example is more or less close to. We are *not* aiming for rigid boundaries that allow for precise determinations e.g. that "this is" [a deliberately developmental space] and "this is not".

## Outlines

### Current (July 2024)

There is an emerging field of "(deliberately) developmental spaces".

These are spaces designed for deep intentional personal and collective development. There is a focus on multidimensional inner growth including holding complexity, expanding worldviews and perspective taking. There is long-term engagement for sustained development and rigorous practice design.

These spaces relate to, build on and are an evolution of existing environments ranging from executive MBAs to retreat centers to 12-step programmes to intentional communities (ecovillages).

They are distinguished by an emphasis on **sustained, multi-dimensional** inner development practice [in service of paradigmatic transition]

- Sustained: "more than a weekend [or a week]". These spaces are about "states to traits" i.e. looking for developmental stage shifts. As such, they often require sustained engagement e.g. months rather than days.
- Multi-dimensional: Informed modern developments in "ontological" practice and sciences ranging from neo-piagetian skills theory to mindfulness research and meditative traditions
- Service: this is not just development for its own sake or for personal thriving, it is to support service to wider society.
- Purpose: this service is more than general amelioriation, it is in service of a "paradigmatic transition" i.e. a profound shift in the basic worldviews and institutions of modern societies.

Additional qualities include an empirical orientation emphasizing active assessment, learning and sharing. 

### Developmental Spaces for an Age of Transition (Nov 2021)

> We advocate for new kinds of environments - "developmental spaces" - to support the deep, sustained multidimensional inner development that is critically needed.

Full outline in appendix:

> Many existing programs or activities from parenting to school clearly involve some form of (inner) development. So what differs about what we are proposing:
> 
> - **Integrated:** grounded in a multidimensional ontological development model derived from over a hundred years of science (and thousands of years of wisdom traditions). It is multidimensional in recognizing multiple independent, interacting lines of development e.g. cognitive, psycho-emotional, spiritual etc. It is integrated in that it seeks to address all of these different aspects.
> - **Sustained:** nurturing deep and sustained change that integrates into “daily life”. More below.
> - **Accessible:** designed to be proximate to and integrated with the mainstream – in contrast to, say, monasteries which have provided one kind of sustained developmental program for thousands of years. 
> - **Intentional/deliberate**: in this program nurturing and supporting personal and collective development is an explicit goal and a central aspect of the program’s design and delivery
> 
> What is (inner) development?
> 
> We are all clear that children develop in substantial ways: not just physically but mentally. There is now substantial evidence that adults can continue to develop in multiple dimensions of their being – cognitively, emotionally, and even spiritually.[8](https://lifeitself.org/blog/developmental-spaces-for-an-age-of-transition#user-content-fn-8)
> 
> We use the term “being” (and ontological) rather than, say, psyche/psychology or consciousness because we think it better captures the entire spectrum from body to mind to spirit. We also want to avoid the“mind/body” divisions that are often implicit when we talk about psychological development – much cognition is embodied etc.
> 
> What is _sustained_ development?
> 
> Most simply put sustained means going “from states to traits”. That is, going beyond having a one-off experience of a capacity – a “state” – to having that capacity ongoingly sustained – a “trait”.
> 
> For example, a child when first learning to stand may only manage this for a few seconds. This would be a temporary state not a trait, it would not be sustained growth. Sustained growth would be when they are consistently able to stand.
> 
> Similarly, we want to nurture sustained adult development. For example, many of us may have had powerful experiences on retreat or at events, yet can find it hard to maintain and integrate those insights once back in our “daily lives”.
> 
> What is multidimensional (growth)?
> 
> Multidimensional means encompassing multiple dimensions of our “being” e.g. cognitive, psycho-emotional, moral, spiritual etc.

### First definition 2020

Developed in 2019-2020 and published Feb 2021.

The first sketch of a definition was in the [original essay](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis):

> Physically colocated groups together for a sustained period of time with a conscious engagement in multidimensional developmental praxis.

Enlarging on this there were three specific characteristics:

> **1. Space**. These environments are spaces in both a physical and temporal sense. They are a site for a group to live, work, practice and engage with one another with shared time that can be dedicated to these ends.  
> 
> **2. Developmental**_._ These environments are explicitly _developmental_ spaces: their practices and activities revolve around fostering the growth of participants “ontologically”, both individually and collectively. As discussed above, ontological development is a shorthand for sustained development in the capacities which enable us to make sense of and engage with the world around us, particularly in how this relates to our own inner states. This can extend to more traditional education but also, and arguably more importantly, the domains often covered by spirituality and personal development such as emotional intelligence, self-knowledge and so on.
> 
> **3. Deliberate**. Development is _intentional_ in that both the creators and participants are consciously orientated towards ontological development. This may not be the exclusive focus (as it is with. traditional monasticism, for example). However, it should be a clear, conscious and central component of their participation.

Over time we've tended to reduce the emphasis on physical colocation and emphasize more the relative intensity of engagement and commitment. For example, it's possible a group meeting very regularly online over a year could offer more than a group together for one week in person.
