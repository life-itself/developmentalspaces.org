## Vision  

Creating a Transformative Culture through awakening and expanding our consciousness, individually and collectively.
## Core values 

By recognizing the power in community and interpersonal process work, we intentionally deepen our capacity for authenticity and intimacy, compassion and connection. Our innate interdependence calls us to social and ecological justice for all life on earth. We see nature and every element of creation as sacred, with human beings nestled inside the whole.
