## Vision  

Along with their core values, a key vision that they have is reimagining work. As they put it on their website, "Let´s think New Work one step further. How about a holistic concept where we live in intentional, value-driven communities? How about re-shaping our current lifestyle to a regenerative one, in support of and in harmony with nature, focused on what truly matters?"

## Core values 

**Lifelong learning and development**. There is immense potential in the change of environment and routines to get in touch with different cultures and people. We believe in the power of a diverse community with shared purpose. To us, New Work is a wholistic and impact-driven life concept. We hold space for those potentials to unfold.

**Nature** is freedom, nourishment of creativity and re-connection with our mother earth. We need to establish alternative, regenerative living solutions for ourselves and our planet. Remote work enables us to move out of cities and re-discover life in nature. We build a community for connected and aligned humans to be able to live this value, even when traveling.

**Connection**. We are aware of our essence, our true, authentic self and what really matters to us. We are open to connect to a diverse group of like-minded people who share the same values. We connect by sharing experiences, talents, knowledge and joy. We build bridges to integrate digital with local communities. We respect each other and do not judge in the knowledge that we all act according to our best ability.
## Program

Agaia offers immersive residencies for both teams and individuals. They last from five days to four  weeks. In each kind of program, there is an emphasis on coliving, coworking, and cocreation. In many cases, they tailor the focus and practices within the program based on the people that sign up, and not vice versa. 
## Practices
