## Vision 

YIP aims to strengthen young people’s capacity to take personal and collective initiative in the face of current global realities.The term “societal entrepreneur” as used by YIP describes people and initiatives that base their actions in service of society and understand the world as one interconnected living organism. This paradigm points to the interconnectedness of global systems and new ways of working toward a more equitable world. Through allowing young people to explore this paradigm and with it face and develop themselves and society, YIP seeks to support these young people to become leaders of a new, more sustainable and integrated lifestyle and future. 

## Core values 

1. See the world as one interconnected living organism 
2. Explore the relationship between freedom and responsibility
3. Activate intellectual, social, emotional, and practical capacity by engaging the whole human being 

## Program 

The program lasts for 10 months. 20-40 participants learn, create and organize alongside experts, facilitators and innovators. YIP’s curriculum provides a platform for young people to expand their understanding, develop their fullest potential and find their authentic tasks in society and the world.

## Practices

They provide the following learning modules: Collaboration and community dynamics; inner awareness; global realities; internship; self designed curriculum weeks; and integration and transition. 

The morning courses consist of contributor-led content and afternoon of applied mentor-led practices. The afternoon activities are generally more hands on and practical. They are intended to balance out the more academic morning courses and be in support of output, rather than input. Each day has its specific theme and title and is split into two time-slots. The activities of the afternoons change each module.
