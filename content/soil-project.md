## The Soil Project 

The Soil Project (TSP) is an international alternative higher education and gap year program serving as an initiative toward a new paradigm of education in 21st century by completely changing the way that education has been happened including philosophy, educational goals, content and learning methods and even credentials.

## Vision 

The program aims to support young people’s development by providing a nourishing foundation. They describe their educational philosophy as ‘soil education’. This means creating a foundation of ‘holistic learning and basic knowledge’ and supporting learners with the ‘community, and necessary resources’ they need to grow in their own ways and own directions.

## Core values 

Development is inner and outer, in service of paradigmatic transformation of education and society more broadly: the program is for young people a ‘journey of understanding themselves within and exploring and serving the outside world’. They talk about ‘education’ rather than ‘development’. They use the word ‘seeds’ to refer to the learners/participants in their program. This fits with the metaphor of their ‘soil education’ philosophy. 
 
## Program 

There are 4 6-month modules: Body and Mind Cultivation; Sustainable Living & Development; New Story and Future of the World; Entrepreneurship & Meaningful Livelihood. Each 6-month module goes through a cycle of 3 parts: Structured Curriculum; Self Learning Journey; and Reflection and Sharing. Learning experiences take place across Vietnam, Thailand, and India. 

## Practices

Learners take part in Head, Hands, Heart, and Healing the World education, i.e. cultivating: knowledge and intellectual skills; physical, practical skills, e.g. cooking, gardening, construction; compassion, empathy, and emotional skills;  and capacity to contribute positively to the transformation of society. Frameworks and practices include: Mindfulness; Nonviolent Communication; Process Work; Internal Family Systems; Natural Farming; concept of [‘Alivelihood’](https://www.alivelihood.org/).
