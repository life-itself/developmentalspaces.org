This website intends to pool resources and information on "transformational spaces". 
It is part of a wider project at Life Itself, in conjunction with Fetzer, Ekskaret, and Commonweal to gather data on and eventually build a field for transformational spaces. Our focus is on an initial "survey of the field", and to map stakeholders and programs and start forging connections and awareness.  Now, we are on programs for youth and young adults (15-25 years old) in the US and Europe, and we will be exploring what it means to be a "transformational space", profile relevant organizations, looking at their programs, approach and philosophy.

For now, we define transformational spaces in the following way: 

**1. Space**. These environments are spaces in both a physical and temporal sense. They are a site for a group to live, work, practice and engage with one another with shared time that can be dedicated to these ends.  

**2. Developmental**_._ These environments are explicitly _developmental_ spaces: their practices and activities revolve around fostering the growth of participants “ontologically”, both individually and collectively. As discussed above, ontological development is a shorthand for sustained development in the capacities which enable us to make sense of and engage with the world around us, particularly in how this relates to our own inner states. This can extend to more traditional education but also, and arguably more importantly, the domains often covered by spirituality and personal development such as emotional intelligence, self-knowledge and so on.

**3. Deliberate**. Development is _intentional_ in that both the creators and participants are consciously orientated towards ontological development. This may not be the exclusive focus (as it is with. traditional monasticism, for example). However, it should be a clear, conscious and central component of their participation.

Of particular importance as we move forward from higher level discussions around principles such as this one, are questions of implementation. Of particular interest are:

- What physical form these spaces should take to maximise their developmental potential
- How they might be funded to ensure they're scaleable without collapsing simply into 'luxury' experiences for the privileged
- How we should design experiments and evaluation frameworks which can both rigorously establish the impact of the spaces while being practical for real world use
- How we might marshall the learnings from other spaces and communities and apply them to new contexts

These are all questions we hope to address in our further work.
