## Embercombe 

Embercombe is a 50 acre 're-wilding estate' located in England. They offer a range of courses and programs that helps participants to "reconnect with the wild authentic self and to live a passionate and purposeful life in service of a flourishing world for all species."

## Vision

- Gain a clearer understanding of yourself, your gifts and your direction and purpose in life
- Learn how to embody your ‘centered self’ and the relationship between rhythm and being
- Become alive to your creativity
- Deepen your relationship with our land and develop new friendships, to create a tribe
- Explore the fundamental issues we face, individually and collectively, to imagine positive futures
- Explore ways of navigating uncertainty and the uncomfortable with courage and an inner confidence

## Core values 

The foundational value of Embercombe is the "Children's fire". As they put on their website, "the Children’s Fire is a song of love, to life. It is a commitment to the responsibility carried by each successive generation to safeguard the vitality and regenerative capacity of the earth. It is a mind-set, culture, philosophy and design principle. It can and must be observable within politics, religion, art, business, education, health services, economics and our daily lives."

They also emphasize the "twin trail" of inner work and outer action, in service of a flourishing world for all species.  

## Program

Most of the their programs last for a day or two. Their 'Catalyst' program is a 6-day residential program for 18–25-year-olds who want to develop and grow, carve their own path and connect with others who want to make positive change. The Catalyst is a creative and transformational program, a rite of passage for young adults at a transitional stage in life.

## Practices 

The different practices depend on the different programs, although there is a continued focus on rewilding and "children's fire".
