Multiple people we spoke with emphasized that “development” is a “spiritual” kind of process, and yet that a lot of developmental work does not use this kind of language or framing.  How might we make space for the spiritual aspect of development while also making sure that funders and other potential stakeholders (who might be resistant to a ‘spiritual’ language or framing) are able to remain open to engagement or collaboration? 

  

## Using the word [[development]]?

  

As previously mentioned, some of the organizations that we have interviewed, like MAPLE, are deliberate in their avoidance of the notion of development. In some ways, the word “development” suggests a particular worldview and ontological process that some organizations do not agree with. While the word development might be appropriate in certain cases, like, for example, due to its broad stroke across all different kinds of programs that are listed in this project, the word in itself might be scrutinized more deeply so as to consider how the DDS field contains organizations and worldviews that do not make use of the word development.

## Mapping the actors in the field 

Along with getting a sense for some of the language and concepts in the field, we also hope to get a sense for what this field looks like and how it might be mapped. At this point in time, we suggest that there are four different kinds of actors in the field: connectors, DDS’s, participants, and learners. Certainly, these groups are subject to change or to be further categorized into subgroups; ie, it is possible to see ‘funders’ as a subcategory of connectors. 


Connectors: This group contains the organizations who funded this report, as well as any other organizations or individuals who are concerned with connecting, funding, researching, and building the field in whatever way makes most sense. 

DDS: Deliberately Developmental Spaces, as outlined in the introduction, are physically co-located groups together for a sustained period of time with a conscious engagement in multidimensional developmental praxis.
  

Participants: Young adults and youth who are interested in getting involved in a DDS.


Learners: Someone who is interested in learning about DDS as a field, about different models and notions of ‘development’.

## Considering what we mean by 'Education'

This blog post here emphasizes a little more about how one might consider education in this context. 

## Modern affordances 

Might be viewed as affordances which are particularly 'modern', and are concerned with how we maintain ourselves and develop within a modern world. 'Modern affordances'. the environment, or space, in many ways, allows certain models of development, or challenges in certain spaces. 

  
Even within a DDS, we are not necessarily free of modern affordances. Modern affordances might be characterized as the ways in which we have a 'modern' environment which enables certain challenges and ways of being. In some ways, modern affordances are never avoided, and deliberately developmental spaces might be viewed, in some sense, as a sort of therapeutic space in which healing becomes possible from some of these possible affordances. Modern affordances might be characterized as the challenge of keeping up with certain kinds of challenges, most of which are financial or career related.
