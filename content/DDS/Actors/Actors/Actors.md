Within this project, one of the main purposes that we currently have is to figure out how different actors in the field might support each other. Part of this requires a better understanding of the needs of each of the actors in the field, although, at this point in time, one might assume that mapping the field and establishing an initial connection between the different kinds of actors is a first step in figuring out how this support might take place. Thus, figuring out the best ways that different actors might support each other requires a better understanding of what support is needed and what are the capacities of the field.

We have split them up into four different categories of actors: connectors, DDS’s, participants, and learners.

**Connectors 

This broad group contains the organizations who funded this report, as well as any other organizations or individuals who are concerned with connecting, funding, researching, and building the field in ways that go beyond information spreading. 

**DDS**

Deliberately Developmental Spaces, as outlined in the introduction, are physically co-located groups together for a sustained period of time with a conscious engagement in multidimensional developmental praxis.

**Participants**

Young adults and youth who are interested in getting involved in a DDS

**'Learners**

Someone who is interested in learning about DDS as a field, about different models and notions of ‘development’.
