## [[Ecology of practices]]

An ecology of practices refers to the ways in which an organisation has developed a set of ways to achieve their goal. In many ways, it is inherently connected to an ontological framework, or a model of development. Organizations that are able to incorporate the two in a meaningful way are, in many ways, interesting organizations. Here, this section serves as a way to consider the many different practices and programs that an organization has. It could have a number of different ones or just a few. An example that We use here is [[The Monastic Academy]], which outlines a particular schedule and a routine for their residency.
