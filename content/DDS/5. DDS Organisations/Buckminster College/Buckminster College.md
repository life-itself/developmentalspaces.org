## Background 

Buckminster college is an educational experiment, which aims to transform the traditional arc and aims of education. By focusing more on 'context' opposed to 'content', the overall aim of the program is to develop the necessary skills and capacities for people to learn about how to manage and exist in a complex world. 

Buckminster College operates according to the [International Baccalaureate (IB)](https://www.ibo.org/) curriculum framework, which is recognised by local and national governments around the world. The IB system, started in 1968 in Geneva, connects 5,400 schools worldwide. The framework enjoys international reputation for excellence and quality and opens a well-grounded, advantageous entry path to the world’s best universities.

IB programmes provide an education that crosses disciplinary, cultural, national, and geographical boundaries. In a manner deeply aligned with our guiding [Spaceship Earth](https://buckminstercollege.org/spaceship-earth/) concept, IB education develops citizens of the world: people who recognise and value their common humanity and their deep interconnectedness with all other beings on the planet.

Buckminster College is established as a private, non-subsidised, non-governmental activity, carried out in the legal form of a Belgian non-profit organisation (l’association internationale sans but lucratif). We are academically affiliated as an educational outreach spinoff of [the Center Leo Apostel (CLEA) of the Free University in Brussels (VUB)](https://clea.research.vub.be/).

The idea of Buckminster College departs from several principles according to which school education tends to be organised. Some of these departures reflect the accelerating, asynchronous, and divergent character of our curricula. For example, instead of the conventional division into school subjects (math, history, physics, geography, etc.), we opt for the accommodation of diverse learning trajectories and styles within a web of interconnected interdisciplinary _research expeditions_ and _workshop spaces_.

## [[Developmental Model]]


'The Developmental Model' or 'map' is more of an 'onboarding'. It takes the metaphor from Buckminster Fuller about our Earth being a 'spaceship' and the role of education as figuring out how to board this spaceship. As the website writes: 

‘Our little Spaceship Earth is only eight thousand miles in diameter, which is almost a negligible dimension in the great vastness of space. Our nearest star – our energy-supplying mother-ship, the Sun – is ninety-two million miles away, and the next nearest star is one hundred thousand times further away. […] Our little Spaceship Earth is right now traveling at sixty thousand miles an hour around the sun and is also spinning axially […]. That is a whole lot of spin and zip’, writes Richard Buckminster Fuller ([1969](https://books.google.be/books?id=DqflDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s)).  ‘Spaceship Earth was so extraordinarily well invented and designed that to our knowledge humans have been on board it for two million years not even knowing that they were on board a ship’.

‘Now there is one outstandingly important fact regarding Spaceship Earth’, continues Fuller, ‘and that is that no instruction book came with it.’

Nevertheless, generation after generation, young Earthians join the crew with no choice other than to trust the orientation classes received from those who arrived here just a few decades earlier… What should their orientation classes be like? Where are the instructions to be sourced from? We have the seemingly safe choice of sourcing the training structures from the ways in which we ourselves used to be trained. But is this choice really all that safe for the ones we teach?

What we hope to achieve in our programmes, is to invoke in our learners a spirit of adventure, exploration and pursuit of knowledge.
## [[Ecology of practices]]

**Residential sessions** are organised at the VUB campus in Brussels, Etterbeek (10 sessions), in Bruges (6 sessions), and in Dinant (2 sessions). These session include 3 or 4 nights in hostel/b&b accommodation, community meals, and days full of group activities, movement, and action. The residential sessions take place every two weeks, starting on Monday evening or Tuesday morning (subject to individual preference) and ending on Friday afternoon, and the [[immersive]] element is a key part of the learning process. 

**Remote sessions** allow for a more introverted time at home, dedicated to interactive online classes, self-paced reading/writing, and plenty of bodily and manual engagements. The remote sessions engage learners comprehensively from 9:45 till 16:00 (except for Wednesdays ending at 12:45 – 0r at 14:00 if including lunch), guiding them through all school day routines which include intense ‘research expeditions’, daily exercise, artistic activities, and real-time video-instructed lunch preparation.
