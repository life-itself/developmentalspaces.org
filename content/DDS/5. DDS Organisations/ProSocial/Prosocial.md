## Background 

ProSocial is, perhaps more than any other organization, interested in [systemic change] and developing models which can contribute to systemic level change. Insofar as they consider this conceptually, they develop and or apply [evolutionary] models, and consider how 'selection criteria' relates to behavior at a number of different levels. The purpose of the group on their website is: Consciously evolve a world that works for all.

We believe that to catalyze rapid, positive cultural change we need to recognize our interconnectedness and continuously improve the relationships we have with ourselves, each other and the planet.
## [[Developmental Model]] 

Through a process of humble inquiry and practical application of both inner and outer work, ProSocial helps foster collaboration within and between groups at multiple scales – emulating the [cooperation] of a multicellular super-organism. 

The organization does its best to use evolutionary principles.

## [[Ecology of practices]]

The practices are always unique, depending on the team or organization. 

In this way, the ProSocial Core Processes are typically not followed in a linear fashion. In the beginning, much back-and-forth movement is necessary to ensure a truly participatory process. Essentially, this is learning to ‘name ourselves’. This allows for and encourages a combination of perspective-taking and the negotiation of meaning, an essential ingredient for the success of all processes. Practically speaking, the overall process is a deep enquiry into our personal and cultural identities that is simultaneously shaped by our personal and community histories and the selection of a future that is worth living for now.
