## Background 

Drawing on ancient pan-cultural rites of passage practices, the mission of Blue Ridge Rights of Passage (BRROP) is to support, nourish and inspire the next generation of emerging leaders, in the context of the troubled times we are living through. At the heart of the metacrisis is a widespread loss of meaning, disconnection, and digital alienation, converging in a mental health epidemic that is hitting younger generations as canaries in the coal mine of the modern world. BRROP is a direct response to this dire situation.

BRROP is a fellowship, questing in camaraderie to understand how to be in right relationship with the world, as integral members of the Earth community. We come together in this initiatory process to inspire creativity, liberate authenticity, awaken our inherent gifts, and deepen our connections to ourselves, our communities, and our world.

Traditional rites of passage consist of 3 phases: severance, threshold, and incorporation. In short, we are severed from life as we have known it (leaving our normal plugged-in life to be with the wild Earth); we cross the threshold into a liminal space (4-day solo with no food or shelter); and then we return to our communities (to whom we offer the gifts we have received).

## [[Developmental Model]]

Unlike some other organizations, the model is much more 'free' and not very strict. The main idea is to create a sense of 'belonging' in Nature, which is primarily done through the vision quest. The entire program, which lasts more than six months, is about split up into 3 phases: severance, threshold, and incorporation. The vision quest itself only lasts a few days, but the entire process is a number of months. 

The main context and aim of the BRROP is to gain a sense of belonging in a world which makes belonging a difficult task. Listed are the many benefits or aims of the program: 

- A deepened sense of belonging, wholeness, and connection to community.
    
- The opportunity to clarify values that can act as a guiding star or life philosophy.
    
- A strengthened kinship with the Living Earth.
    
- Awakened leadership capacities.
    
- An education in the practice of council and “bare bones ceremony.”
    
- Embodied confidence, activated potential, and an engaged, self-authoring sense of possibility.
    
- A profound experience that informs future pathways.

## [[Ecology of practices]]

BRROP’s flagship program **Becoming and Belonging: a threshold initiation** is a transformative journey for folks between 18 - 30. It’s a crossing of a threshold in a sacred container in a world that has lost touch with essential ways of marking rites of passage.

The entire program, which lasts more than six months, is about split up into 3 phases: severance, threshold, and incorporation. The vision quest itself only lasts a few days, but the entire process is a number of months. 

**Becoming and Belonging** (the flagship program of Blue Ridge Rites of Passage) is an initiatory journey for folks between 18-30 and a response to the troubled times we are living through. The program consists of four main components: group council, 1-on-1 coaching/mentoring, medicine walks, and a multi-day vision fast. The curriculum guides participants through a deep inquiry into personal and collective cosmologies, immerses them in the depths of the living world, and supports them to identify and live into their gifts, all within a nourishing and supportive community context.
