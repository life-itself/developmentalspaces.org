## [[Developmental Model]]

Academics, student self-government & manual labor are the three pillars of learning at Deep Springs. Students are expected to dedicate themselves to lives of service to humanity, take real responsibility for and ownership of the community. Students are treated not as consumers but as creators of their education and as stewards of a joint intellectual project. 

## [[Ecology of practices]]

Classes, which are constructed around seminar-style discussion and often have fewer than eight participants, rely heavily on student preparation, participation and engagement.  Students are encouraged to think critically on how each course can improve, attempting to improve their own participation, giving feedback to other students and the professor, and often helping decide questions of class structure. A ‘Student Body’ is formed and is responsible for many aspects of running the College, admitting students, hiring faculty, and reviewing student and faculty performance. 

  

Each student also labors roughly twenty hours each week. Labor positions include working on the farm and ranch, as well as daily tasks of cooking, cleaning, and maintaining facilities and vehicles. Emphasizing personal discipline and an immersion experience, ground rules applying at all times to students:

  

1. Prohibiting the use of intoxicating alcohol and other drugs
    
2. Students cannot leave Deep Springs during the regular academic term except on official or academic trips,, or in the case of medical emergency.
