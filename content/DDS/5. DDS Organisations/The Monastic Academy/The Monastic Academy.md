## Background

MAPLE is a community of practitioners **exploring the intersection of AI and wisdom.** As the world becomes increasingly dominated by algorithms and data processing, we bring our practice into the heart of this critical planetary moment. Rooted in wisdom and love, we are striving to build trustworthy systems for human and artificial intelligence.

## [[Developmental Model]]

MAPLE doesn't have a model of 'development', but instead orbits around a few principles, like [[awakening]] and responsibility. 

First, we must be willing to believe there is a way forward. Only then do we become willing to change our lives. There is a way to **live that acknowledges our deep interconnectedness and refuses to sacrifice long-term sustainability for short-term gain.** This takes courage, determination, and love. It requires us to look at and overcome the seeds of hatred, greed, and ignorance rooted in our minds through diligent and continuous practice.
## [[Ecology of practices]]

We are a residential, non-profit, contemplative training center. Each day is a mixture of dedicated contemplative practice, non-profit work, buildings and grounds maintenance, and community involvement. We start early, end late, and train six days a week, year-round.

We begin with **chanting and meditation** at 4:40am each morning, followed by an hour of **exercise** and **silent breakfast**. From there, we move into either **non-profit work** or **intensive practice** until **lunch**.

We do **chores** together after lunch, and then have a few hours of free **time to practice on our own**, spend time together, and stay abreast of the world.

In the evening we have another period of either **non-profit work** or **intensive practice**, and we come back together for **meditation** at 7pm each evening, followed by **chanting**, which ends around 9pm.
