Here in the organizations section, we would like to outline the many different organizations we have looked into. Particularly, this section will also include organizations which themselves have their own 'developmental model and their own ecology of practices'. By incorporating the two, these kinds of organizations are able to have their own meaningful outlook and voice on what makes a space developmental. 

## Background 



## [[Ontological Frameworks]] 

The term 'ontological framework' makes more sense here for a few reasons: first, because some organizations, like the monastic academy, or blue ridge rites of passage, explicitly eschew a model of development. We find that these ways of thinking about development themselves are especially important and insightful, and in this project, should be considered. 

A second reason that this should  be considered is that 'ontological' is a word that makes a lot of sense to use in these circumstances. While some organizations have a specific ontological  framework , it makes sense as well to consider how different ontological frameworks are a part of an ontological (). 

Lastly, and relate to the first point, is that there is not a specific 'model' of how it happens in some cases. In many cases, like for example, the Buckminster college, or in blue ridge rites of passage, belonging or something similar  is used as the guiding concept of the organization . 
## [[Ecology of practices]]

Here, this section serves as a way to consider the many different practices and programs that an organization has. It could have a number of different ones or just a few.
