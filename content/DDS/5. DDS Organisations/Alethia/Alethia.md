## Background 

[You can visit Alethia's website here](https://integralunfoldment.com/)
## [[Developmental Model]]

Development as 'self-enfoldment' (I am already whole and complete and all I need to do is discover more and more my innate qualities) as opposed to 'self-improvement' (something is wrong or lacking in me and so I need to be fixed or improved) - 'Psychological and spiritual development is not a journey from the shallows to the depths. Rather, it is a journey of consciously inhabiting more and more of oneâ€™s depth'. Development is not linear but involves 'several concurrent and overlapping threads of unfoldment' at any one moment (p.8) - Development requires: a) releasing limiting emotional learnings and b) creating new emotional learnings - --> This seems similar to ideas about need for 'masculine' and 'feminine' types of healing (link to e.g. Aaron Abke video) - The aim of development is: 'developing a fresh sense of self that is not deficient but instead capable of navigating the complex challenges of life' (p.3) - Framework of 'four depths of contact with the present moment' in which development/unfoldment takes place: - Depth of Parts - Depth of Process - Depth of Presence - Depth of Nonduality - Development happens in relationship/is a relational process

## [[Ecology of practices]]

Based on these four different 'depths', which are and entangled to some degree and depend on particular people in particular contexts, different methods are used to help one meet oneself and explore and experience greater self contact.
