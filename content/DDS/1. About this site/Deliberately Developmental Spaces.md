This site stems from the Deliberately Developmental Spaces project which involved  Life Itself, Fetzer, Commonweal and Ekskaret.  Together, the goal of the project was to coalesce the field of deliberately developmental spaces, or spaces which are concerned with holistic human development. In particular, it sought to find programs for the age range of (15-25) in Europe and the United States, which offered particular programs and practices to enable this kind of development. Throughout the research, a number of interesting models, practices, insights, and questions have emerged, and this website serves as a way to convey this information. 


## [[Developmental Model]] 

We use the term 'Developmental Model' to refer to all kinds of ontological frameworks, or maps. Interestingly, in some cases, the very notion of [[development]] is questioned as part of the overall framework, like for, example, in [[The Monastic Academy]], or [[Alethia]] We find that these ways of thinking about development themselves are especially important and insightful, and in this project, should be considered. 

## [[Ecology of practices]]

Here, this section serves as a way to consider the many different practices and programs that an organization has. It could have a number of different ones or just a few.
