## [[Developmental Model]]

We use the term 'Developmental Model' to refer to all kinds of ontological frameworks, or maps. Interestingly, in some cases, the very notion of [[development]] is questioned as part of the overall framework, like for, example, in [[The Monastic Academy]], or [[Alethia]] We find that these ways of thinking about development themselves are especially important and insightful, and in this project, should be considered.
