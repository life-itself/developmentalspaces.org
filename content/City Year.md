## Description 

City Year is a program that connects gap year students to organizations that aim to build and foster [[community]] and educational connections through the 1-year student success coach program. They recruit and train AmeriCorps members who serve in schools, partner with teachers to support student academic, social and emotional growth. 
  
## Vision 

City Year AmeriCorps members not only make a difference in the lives of students they serve, but also acquire valuable civic skills that help them and prepare them to lead their communities and their careers to be of service to a cause greater than self. They foster a blend of great humility with intense professional will. They aim to share what they are learning and contribute to a broader conversation about how to ensure equitable access to learning opportunities for all students, prioritize collaboration and emphasize empathy. 
## Core values 

Their commitment to educational equity and social justice is the foundation for the work of their success coaches. Thought leaders across the education sector suggest that equity begins with the behaviors, systems, processes, resources and environments that ensure each member of the school community is provided fair, just and individualized learning and growth opportunities, with an ubuntu mindset: I am a person through other people; my humanity is tied to yours. These principles are summarized by what they term a “universal practice” which goes beyond classroom space to integrate the school community and beyond. 
## Program 

Student Success coach program

## Practices 

Student success coaches are trained and supported throughout the year to continue their own learning and growth throughout the challenges and opportunities that emerge. They seek to eliminate any stigma that might be attached to students who receive individual or small-group services and support. Coaches and site-based support staff work to create meaning throughout the school such that everyone understands that the City Year AmeriCorps members are here to serve the entire community.
