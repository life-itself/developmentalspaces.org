## Description 

ILALI is an organization concerned with inner transformation as it relates to place, societal change, and  aims to bring together  ‘social’, ‘spiritual’ and ‘scientific’ technology in order to find meaningful ways of learning and living.

## Vision 

Ilali aims to build meaningful regional networks which serve as places for innovative living and learning practices for young adults to take part in so as to transform their communities and themselves. 
## Core values 

There is an emphasis in the organization on worldview literacy: importantly, ‘worldviews’ are not merely intellectual artifacts, but embodied processes, or ways of being and ways of relating. Ilali believes that by understanding through our own bodies the worldviews of others, we might become more ‘developed’, and development is viewed here as, at least in part, the ability to take into consideration other beings when making decisions. Additionally, there are certain practices which might help to enable worldview literacy, which are explored in the Wayfinders program.

## Program 

Way finders- an 8 week program currently being offered in the greater Seattle region. 

## Practices 

The Wayfinders program aims to create strong regional networks for innovative learning and living. Many of the practices and activities offered in this program are collaborative and co-creative, and thus aim to create an atmosphere which strengthens values of community and cooperation. In total, the program lasts for eight weeks and supports the resilience and transformation of communities and their regions through programs where we learn to embody knowledge, bridge cultural worldviews, and promote collective healing in service of our future. By striving to collect a number of diverse young adults, and making the program accessible, the intention is to create an immersive and unique space which allows young people to adjust themselves to nature, to others, and to themselves.
