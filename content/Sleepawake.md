Sleepawake is a 4-week residential intensive for 18-27 year olds to explore the potent paths to embodied, engaged, and authentic living.

## Vision 

According to their website, Sleepawake is "A place to learn the difficult skills that few of us are taught. Everything from self-awareness and metacognition, to how to regulate yourself during emotional intensity, navigating through conflict, owning your desires in your life, expressing your full creativity, not acting out of obligation, to how to cook for yourself and so much more."

## Core values 

Their core values are outline in detail on their website, and are, in brief a commitment to service; welcoming the intelligence in everything; following excitement; well being; speaking from the heart; and trusting the journey. 
 
## Program 

The program last 4 week and is meant to be an immersive experience in which one learns to 'show up fully in life.' As they put it on their website, 'Sleepawake is an emotional immersion program. What’s the best way to gain fluency in a language? Go where it’s spoken. Get ready to dive into emotional language and practice, understand a whole new culture of being in the world, and be held in a safe container filled with peers doing their own inner work.'

## Practices

They highlight the 'six dimensions of learning' for the program, which are emotional and relational intelligence, embodiment, creative expression, self awareness, and physical health and nutrition. Although they don't include specific practices, one can assume that they stem from these aspects of the curiculum.
