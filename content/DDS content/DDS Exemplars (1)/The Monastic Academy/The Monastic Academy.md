# Description

Maple has traditionally served as a Buddhist residency, and recently have rebranded, to some degree, as a community of practitioners exploring the intersection of AI and wisdom. 

MAPLE, for the most part, uses the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, or the ‘ten stage model’ from the Mahayana Buddhist tradition which is, in many ways, much more rigorous than other developmental approaches we have come across. Development here (even though the word 'development' can be deemed to be problematic) is not only about cultivating being as an individual, but further directing one's effort towards the liberation of all beings. 

# Vision

In one sense, the vision of Maple is the liberation of all beings. In another sense, it is to gain the required skills for managing and understanding the complexity of our contemporary world, particularly as it relates to the development of meaningful AI. 
# Core Values

MAPLE, for the most part, uses the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, or the ‘ten stage model’ from the Mahayana Buddhist tradition which is, in many ways, much more rigorous than other developmental approaches we have come across. Development here (even though the word 'development' can be deemed to be problematic) is not only about cultivating being as an individual, but further directing one's effort towards the liberation of all beings. 
# Program(s) Structure

At MAPLE, one can train, co work, or be a part of a residency. The residency that we have highlighted here is the AI residency, which allows for coaching and mentorship as it relates to deeply understanding the relationship between careful development of AI that will benefit all life on earth. We find this to be an interesting residency because it focuses on inner development, but makes the link as to how greater and more wise cultivation of our being is required in order to get a greater understanding of artificial intelligence. As far as some of their practices go, ‘MAPLE offers a full daily schedule of meditation, community meals, talks, discussion and relationship building workshops. Additionally, it is important to emphasize here that MAPLE, although the program can certainly be open to people in the age range, it is not necessarily intended as a ‘youth development program’. Part of the reason why we decided to include it, then, is due to their understanding of ‘development’: inspired by a Buddhist framework, they question the nature of development. Such a diversity of development models can be insightful, we think, as it allows us to consider more deeply what exactly we mean when we invoke the term 'deliberately developmental’.
# Practices

The primary practice at MAPLE is meditation, 'a lot of it'.
