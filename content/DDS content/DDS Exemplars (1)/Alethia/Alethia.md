# Description

Alethia is more of a coaching program, which allows participants to learn and embody a particular way of being. It is a bit more 'thereauputic' than some of the other organizations that might appear on this list, and is also open to adults more broadly. 

# Vision

The overall vision of Alethia is to create new networks of emotional learnings, by unlearning some of the previous emotional earnings we have. In a lot of cases, our emotional learnings carry the understanding that we are inadequate, and that we need to improve ourselves. Someone who takes part in the Alethia coaching program is meant to embody the realization that we are complete individuals, and that we only need to increase self contact.
# Core Values

 The aim of development is: 'developing a fresh sense of self that is not deficient but instead capable of navigating the complex challenges of life' The Alethia coaching program believes that, instead of self 'improvement', we ought to consider the possibility that we are complete ourselves already, and that we only need to increase our 'self contact'.

# Program(s) Structure

Unlike most DDS, it can take years, opposed to weeks or months. More informataion on their programs [can be found here](https://integralunfoldment.com/schedule#ACP)

# Practices

Based on these four different 'depths', which are and entangled to some degree and depend on particular people in particular contexts, different methods are used to help one meet oneself and explore and experience greater self contact. 

This happens through 'memory reconsolidation', which is a process which allows one to come into contact with one, or many, of these parts, and work through that particular feeling in a way that transforms ones own self understanding.
