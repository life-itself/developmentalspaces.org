This site stems from the Deliberately Developmental Spaces project which involved  Life Itself, Fetzer, Commonweal and Ekskaret.  Together, the goal of the project was to coalesce the field of deliberately developmental spaces, or spaces which are concerned with holistic human development. In particular, it sought to find programs for the age range of (15-25) in Europe and the United States, which offered particular programs and practices to enable this kind of development. Throughout the research, a number of interesting models, practices, insights, and questions have emerged, and this website serves as a way to convey this information.
