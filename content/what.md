title: What is a (deliberately) developmental space?
---

## Preface: Centers more than boundaries

In talking about the "what" of developmental spaces we emphasize that we prefer the metaphor of centers rather than boundaries. That is, we offer definitions as outlines of a *center* of a conceptual field for developmental spaces -- which a given concrete example is more or less close to. We are *not* aiming for rigid boundaries that allow for precise determinations e.g. that "this is" [a deliberately developmetnal space] and "this is not".

## Outlines

### Current summary

An emerging field of (deliberately) “developmental spaces”

These are spaces designed for deep intentional personal and collective development. There is a focus on multidimensional inner growth including holding complexity, expanding worldviews and perspective taking. Long-term engagement and rigorous practice design.

These spaces relate to, build on and are an evolution of existing environments ranging from executive MBAs to retreat centers to 12-step programmes to intentional communities (ecovillages).

They are distinguished by an emphasis on **sustained, theory-informed, research-assessed and multi-dimensional** inner development practice [in service of paradigmatic transition]

- Sustained = "more than a weekend [or a week]". This is about states to traits i.e. looking for developmental stage shifts.
- Informed by modern developments in "ontological" practice and sciences ranging from neo-piagetian skills theory to mindfulness research and meditative traditions
- Service: this is not just development for its own sake or for personal thriving, it is to support service to wider society

### From the 2021 essay

The first sketch of a definition was in the [original essay](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis):

> Physically colocated groups together for a sustained period of time with a conscious engagement in multidimensional developmental praxis.

Enlarging on this there were three specific characteristics:

> **1. Space**. These environments are spaces in both a physical and temporal sense. They are a site for a group to live, work, practice and engage with one another with shared time that can be dedicated to these ends.  
> 
> **2. Developmental**_._ These environments are explicitly _developmental_ spaces: their practices and activities revolve around fostering the growth of participants “ontologically”, both individually and collectively. As discussed above, ontological development is a shorthand for sustained development in the capacities which enable us to make sense of and engage with the world around us, particularly in how this relates to our own inner states. This can extend to more traditional education but also, and arguably more importantly, the domains often covered by spirituality and personal development such as emotional intelligence, self-knowledge and so on.
> 
> **3. Deliberate**. Development is _intentional_ in that both the creators and participants are consciously orientated towards ontological development. This may not be the exclusive focus (as it is with. traditional monasticism, for example). However, it should be a clear, conscious and central component of their participation.

Over time we've tended to reduce the emphasis on physical colocation and emphasize more the relative intensity of engagement and commitment. For example, it's possible a group meeting very regularly online over a year could offer more than a group together for one week in person.
