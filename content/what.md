title: What is a transformative 'deliberately developmental' space?

> We prefer to talk more in terms of centers than boundaries in saying "what" a developmental space is. Specifically, there is no rigid delineation of a development space that allow us to precisely "this is" [a space] and "this is not". Rather, the definitions we offer should be thought of as sketches or outlines of a *center* in a conceptual field which a given instance is more or less close to.

The first sketch of a definition was in the [original essay](lhttps://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis):

> Physically colocated groups together for a sustained period of time with a conscious engagement in multidimensional developmental praxis.

Enlarging on this there were three specific characteristics:

> **1. Space**. These environments are spaces in both a physical and temporal sense. They are a site for a group to live, work, practice and engage with one another with shared time that can be dedicated to these ends.  
> 
> **2. Developmental**_._ These environments are explicitly _developmental_ spaces: their practices and activities revolve around fostering the growth of participants “ontologically”, both individually and collectively. As discussed above, ontological development is a shorthand for sustained development in the capacities which enable us to make sense of and engage with the world around us, particularly in how this relates to our own inner states. This can extend to more traditional education but also, and arguably more importantly, the domains often covered by spirituality and personal development such as emotional intelligence, self-knowledge and so on.
> 
> **3. Deliberate**. Development is _intentional_ in that both the creators and participants are consciously orientated towards ontological development. This may not be the exclusive focus (as it is with. traditional monasticism, for example). However, it should be a clear, conscious and central component of their participation.

Over time we've tended to reduce the emphasis on physical colocation and emphasize more the relative intensity of engagement and commitment. For example, it's possible a group meeting very regularly online over a year could offer more than a group together for one week in person.
