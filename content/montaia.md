## Vision  

Their mission is to work together to facilitate and inspire cultural and ecological change using principles founded in evolutionary group dynamics and social science.
More specifically, their aim is to co-create a way of life that allows for the thriving of both the human and the Earth community around us.

## Core values 

As they put on their website, they emphasize "deepening connection to both self and other, exploring the surrounding wilderness, and supporting local ecological initiatives. We believe that in order to truly thrive as human beings, we must cultivate a healthy and loving relationship with the natural world around us."

## Program

They offer month-long residencies and togetherness research sessions at the  co-living facility in the Eastern Sierra, California, and also offer workshops and wilderness retreats around the globe. At the co-living facility, one can live inside the main house, which has ten rooms, co working spaces, and shared facilities, and spaces for yoga. 

## Practices 

As a place for co-living, they  focus on developing healthy relationships with self, with community, and with the wilderness around us. They also have a focus on sustainability, Both the  electricity and  hot water heating is powered by solar panels.
