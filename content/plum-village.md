## Plum Village 

Plum Village Monastery is a Buddhist monastery of the Plum Village Tradition in the Dordogne, southern France near the city of Bordeaux. It was founded by two Vietnamese monastics, Thích Nhất Hạnh and Chân Không, in 1982.

## Vision 

Creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.

## Core values 

**Mindfulness** is a kind of energy that we generate when we bring our mind back to our body and get in touch with what is going on in the present moment, within us and around us. We become aware of our breathing and come home to our body, fully present for ourselves and whatever we are doing.

## Program 

Plum Village offers a number of different retreats, which can be found here: https://plumvillage.org/retreats/retreats-calendar#filter=.region-na

## Practices 

We enjoy periods of silence, sitting meditation, rest, relaxation, mindful work and play. All practitioners who come to Plum Village are invited to join in the communal activities in their hamlet, whether it is preparing meals, cleaning or washing dishes, as a way of learning to cultivate joy and mindfulness whatever we are doing.
