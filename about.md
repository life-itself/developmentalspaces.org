This website provides resources and information on "developmental spaces" as well as the home for a growing [network of organizations](/network) connecting in this emerging field. It is part of a [wider effort at Life Itself](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2023/06/20/building-field-for-developmental-spaces), in conjunction with Fetzer, Ekskaret and Commonweal, Springboard and LIONE to gather information on, and build a field for, developmental spaces.
