title: Developmental spaces
description: "Cultural incubators for a time of transformation. Wise system transformation depends upon inner growth - but modern societies lack the understanding and tools to support it. We need more Developmental Spaces:
dedicated, growth-oriented spaces where communities engage in sustained, multi-domain inner development in the service of socio-cultural transformation."

# An Emerging Field

A new  field is emerging of "developmental spaces”. Spaces designed for deep, intentional personal and collective development.

There is a focus on multi-dimensional inner growth including holding complexity, expanding worldviews and perspective taking. They involve long-term engagement and rigorous practice design.

These spaces draw inspiration from many existing environments from executive MBAs to retreat centers, from 12-step programmes to intentional communities. They are distinguished by an emphasis on sustained, theory-informed,and multi-dimensional inner development practice.

# Why? 

Today’s interconnected crises stem from the [foundations of globalised culture](https://metacrisis.info): the deep-seated assumptions, values, and perspectives that shape societies. Evidence is mounting that modern civilisation is breaking down in ways that can’t simply be repaired. Renewal is needed at a foundational level – a profound shift in collective worldview. Ways of being and seeing that we are hardly able to imagine from a modern cultural vantage point.

However, modernity and its materialist culture has treated the inner world as irrelevant. As a result, we lack robust, trusted, well-researched institutions dedicated to large-scale inner growth for the common good. The potential for human flourishing and renewal is vast; but our inherited maps of inner development are fragmented. We need scaleable, integrated approaches to inner transformation - sustained by dedicated communities that can weave new cultural narratives.

# What? 

Dedicated spaces of community and ecologies of practice that integrate:

- **Cognitive development** - _Towards greater complexity of thought and understanding_
- **Awakening** - _Spiritual development; growth in the domain of consciousness_
- **Healing** - _Metabolising trauma and integrating unconscious shadows_
- **Evolving worldview** - _Expanding perspectives and circles of care towards a world-centric view_
- **Engaged action** - _Translating inner shifts into active, ethical engagement with the world_

# Manifesto

We call for the creation of transformational "developmental spaces". Spaces that cultivate the capacities to respond to the profound challenges we face.Spaces grounded in the revolutionary research of the last half century about our personal and collective potential for growth and transformation.These spaces can take a multitude of forms from courses and programs to physical environments such as new forms of monasteries or universities.
