Wise system transformation depends upon inner growth - but modern societies lack the understanding and tools to support it. We need more Developmental Spaces:
 
Dedicated, growth-oriented spaces where communities engage in sustained, multi-domain inner development in the service of socio-cultural transformation.


## Why?

Today’s interconnected crises stem from the very foundations of globalised culture: the deep-seated mindsets that shape modern societies. A growing chorus of voices agrees that we can’t simply repair failing modern systems. We’re going to need renewed cultural foundations - amounting to a profound shift in deep-seated, collective worldview. Ways of being and seeing that we are hardly able to imagine from our current cultural vantage point.
