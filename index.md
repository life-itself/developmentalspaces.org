title: Developmental spaces
description: "Cultural incubators for a time of transformation. Wise system transformation depends upon inner growth - but modern societies lack the understanding and tools to support it. We need more Developmental Spaces:
dedicated, growth-oriented spaces where communities engage in sustained, multi-domain inner development in the service of socio-cultural transformation."

## Why? 

Today’s interconnected crises stem from the [foundations of globalised culture](https://news.lifeitself.org/p/from-polycrisis-to-metacrisis-a-short): the deep-seated assumptions, values, and perspectives that shape societies. Evidence is mounting that modern civilisation is breaking down in ways that can’t simply be repaired. Renewal is needed at a foundational level – a profound shift in collective worldview. Ways of being and seeing that we are hardly able to imagine from a modern cultural vantage point.

But within a materialist culture that has treated the inner world as irrelevant, we lack robust, trusted, well-researched institutions dedicated to large-scale inner growth for the common good. The potential for human flourishing and renewal is vast; but our inherited maps of inner development are fragmented. We need scaleable, integrated approaches to inner transformation - sustained by dedicated communities that can weave new cultural stories together.

## What? 

Dedicated spaces of community and ecologies of practice that integrate:

- **Cognitive development** - _Towards greater complexity of thought and understanding_
- **Awakening** - _Spiritual development; growth in the domain of consciousness_
- **Healing** - _Metabolising trauma and integrating unconscious shadows_
- **Evolving worldview** - _Expanding perspectives and circles of care towards a world-centric view_
- **Engaged action** - _Translating inner shifts into active, ethical engagement with the world_
